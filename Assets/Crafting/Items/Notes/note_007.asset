    After a month of searching, U.S. Marshals have
    called off the search for Eliza Daniels. The daughter of Wall Street investor
    Johnny Daniels, the search was marred by a complete lack of information of her
    whereabouts on the night of her disappearance.


    The reward for any information
    of her whereabouts, dead or alive, has now been increased to $50,000.'
